# Los Angeles County Substance-Involved Deaths, 2012–2024

Analyzes medical examiner data on substance-involved deaths in Los Angeles County from 2012 to 2024. The dataset is geocoded to retain only cases where the death occurred within county boundaries.

Code in this repository cleans and processes the data, generates indicators for substance involvement and co-involvement, and summarizes key variables such as age at death, race/ethnicity, and substance co-detections.

A raincloud plot—a combined visualization of a density curve, boxplot, and individual data points—illustrates the distribution of age at death by substance type.

To reproduce the outputs, open the R project in RStudio and run the R Markdown file.

Required packages include tidyverse, lubridate, gtsummary, ggdist, and ggridges.

## Data Source

Data were obtained from the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner. Public access to detailed case information may be restricted.
